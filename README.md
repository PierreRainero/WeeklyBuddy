# WeeklyBuddy

[![Backend Status](https://github.com/PierreRainero/WeeklyBuddy/workflows/Backend_pipeline/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PierreRainero/WeeklyBuddy/actions?query=workflow%3ABackend_pipeline)  

## Description

_WeeklyBuddy_  is a free tool to help people to build a weekly food menu. It came from a personal need but the application aims to be public. I'm limitted to PHP for my backend so I use this project as a sandbox to discover what this language can offer (coming from Java world).  
Be free to post an issue or use this repository to deploy your own instance but I will be happy if you use the online version (more we are to use it more the application can be full of content).
